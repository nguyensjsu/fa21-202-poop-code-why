PROJECT TITLE: Chess Board for two Players
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE: 29/12/2018
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run and start playing, Black first.
AUTHORS: Paola Maneggia
USER INSTRUCTIONS: This project is a simple chess board to play chess
with two players, no AI implemented.
Black plays first. 
A piece can be selected with a mouse click.
A selected piece appears transparent.
Once a piece is selected the legal moves for that piece in that
position are highlighted. Only a legal move can be performed.
Please notice that the following rules are omitted: 
- En passant
- Castling
- Check mate
Capturing a King will not end the game.

Black and White are encoded as 1 (Black) and -1 (White).
This encoding is used to determine the direction of movement
of the Pawn, the image for the Pieces and the player's turn.
