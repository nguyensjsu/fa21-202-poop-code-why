# Poop Code Why

## Summary 

Our team's project is to take the implementation of a simple chess board, and modify it so the game instead follows two new rules.

1. Once selecting a piece, you must move it.

1. The moveset of each piece may not match its rank. (E.g. A pawn may look like a pawn but moves like a bishop.)

Additionally, based off of the starting code, we must implement the following logic, 

1. Identifying a check.

1. Preventing moves that do not block a check. 

1. Identifying Checkmate and ending the game.
