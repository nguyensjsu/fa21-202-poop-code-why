# Poop Code Why

Our team's project is to take the implementation of a simple chess board, and modify it so the game instead follows two new rules.

1.) Once selecting a piece, you must move it.

2.) The moveset of each piece may not match its rank. (E.g. A pawn may look like a pawn but moves like a bishop.)

Additionally, based off of the starting code, we must implement the following logic, 

1.) Identifying a check.

2.) Preventing moves that do not block a check. 

3.) Identifying Checkmate and ending the game.
